# Fishbit
A project dedicated to finding out more about myself through data from Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, and self-surveyed data

# To-do List:
## Data Gathering
* ~~Configure Fitbit app and authentication process, get keys and tokens~~
* ~~Decide what data would be good to use~~
* ~~Analyze Fitbit JSON structures for each endpoint~~
* ~~Get all historical data required and save for analysis in JSON files~~

## Data Wrangling
* ~~Design a plan to transform data into a structure more suitable for analysis.~~
* ~~Convert to tables~~
* Rid tables of redundant data, and create any necessary changes
* Combine sleep data from the two different Fitbit formats/sources.


# Progress
## 8/1/24
* Added basic files
* Analyzed JSON formats from Fitbit API and added all endpoints that will be used in the initial analysis. This is the planning phase for data gathering.

## 8/6/24
* Designed API calls, creating scripts to gather all historical data
* Acquired all data listed out previously, and completed raw data gathering. Moving onto data wrangling.

## 8/7/24
* Created a list of columns wanted and notes on how tables would look from JSON data.
* Created tables from JSON data

## 8/8/24
* Created a few columns from inner JSON data.

## 8/15/24
